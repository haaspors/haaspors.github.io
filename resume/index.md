### Education
* [University of Oslo][uio] (2004, 2011-present)
  * Master of Science in Informatics: programming and networks
* [Gj√∏vik University College][hig] (2001-2004)
  * Bachelor in computer science: programming

### Work experience {#work}
* [Telenor Digital][td] (2015-present)
  * R&D Software Engineer
    * Exploratory engineering in the CTO office with focus on WebRTC and related technologies.
    * Hacking on open source software
      * WebRTC in Firefox (as in the web browser)
      * libcubeb (audio HAL used by Firefox)<br/><br/>
  * Areas of interest obviously includes WebRTC, but also IoT

<br/>

* [Pexip][pexip] (2012-2015)
  * R&D Software Engineer
    * Product: **Pexip Infinity**
      * Software based (read: x86) video conferencing platform
      * Virtualized, distributed and scalable MCU<br/><br/>
   * Areas of interest includes media stack, RTP stack, video mixing and scaling of CPU intensive workloads on NUMA systems.
   I built the RDP stack to bridge MS Lync desktop sharing in both directions.

<br/>

* Tandberg, [Cisco Systems Inc.][cisco] (2007-2012)
  * R&D Software Engineer
    * Product: **Tandberg Movi**/**Cisco Jabber for video**
      * Video conferencing client (Windows, OSX and iOS)
      * SIP signalling
      * Media codecs optimized for x86 and ARM
      * Built on top of OpenSourceSoftware like GLib, GStreamer, Clutter<br/><br/>
  * Areas of interest ranged from the media stack (exclusive A/V codec development) to graphical user interface.
    I built the cross platform UI framework used for real time video playback and menu overlay, on top of
    libclutter which again sits on top of OpenGL/OpenGL ES and the platform specific bits for integration to
    the windowing system. I also was part of prototype development of simulcast support using mainly
    H.264 AVC and proprietary RTP/RTCP end-to-end messaging.
    Before I left I also was part of porting the platform to mobile platforms like Android and iOS.
    On a more fun/hobby side of things, I built the infamous Easter egg in Movi, namely the Tetris game on Windows only.
